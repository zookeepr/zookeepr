This page describes features that are not completed yet or need pratical testing before they're added to the standard feature set. They might disappear or be changed subtantially!

== Miscellaneous ==

 * `[:page name]` and `[:page name:link text]` are a shorter form of `[wiki:Self:...]`, with the additional benefit that both `page name` and `link text` can contain any character, including spaces.
  * Pro: using spaces, and it allows `&#...;` recoding (yet to be added) so that it's possible to add non-western chars into wikinames of western/latin1 wikis. This feature is not needed any more as moin-1.3 supports Unicode.
  * Contra: one more way to link to things

== Bidirectional language support ==

 * `config.language_default` sets the default language of a wiki's ''content''
   * the HTML `lang` attribute of a page's `BODY` tag is set to this language
 * for each language MoinMoin supports in its user interface, a correspondent `[[lang]]` macro exists, e.g. `[[en]]`
   * this macro sets HTML `lang` attributes for paragraphs etc.
   * it also changes the text direction

== User-defined forms ==
