This HTML page contains the basic install docs that can be found on http://moinmaster.wikiwikiweb.de/MoinMoin/InstallDocs. It contains all necessary information to get your wiki up and running, even without being online. If you have a permanent internet connection, you might want to browse the docs on the Help``On``Installing page, which might contain more up-to-date information.

After following the procedures on this page, you should have a working wiki and can browse the rest of the online docs there.

= How to install your own MoinMoin Wiki =
This page describes the installation procedure of MoinMoin. In the next section, there is a list of real-world [#installscenarios Installation Scenarios] that help you to understand how to apply the instructions in different environments. If you already have a wiki running and want to upgrade, see MoinMaster:HelpOnUpdating.

A Moin``Moin installation is done by some elementary steps:
 * [#basic-install Basic Installation] explains the "`setup.py`" step of the installation in more detail. This is uses to get the Moin``Moin code and wiki template installed onto your system. This applies equally to all scenarios, and you should read it before trying a live installation.
 * [#wikiinstance-creation Wiki Instance Creation] explains how you make a new wiki instance (data and configuration), this is also common to all scenarios.
 * Getting the web server to serve static stuff under the `/wiki` URL (url_prefix) - used for theme CSS and images, etc. - this is slightly different for the various web servers that can be used - see below.
 * Getting the web server to execute the moin code when you access wiki pages. This is done either by CGI, FastCGI, mod_python or Twisted or the built-in stand alone server - this is slightly different for the various web servers that can be used - see below.
 * After a successful installation, you might want to read more about configuration and other options that you, as the wiki administrator, can set up. MoinMaster:HelpOnAdministration contains links to pages that cover these topics. Especially, the MoinMaster:HelpOnConfiguration and MoinMaster:HelpOnUpdating pages provide additional information regarding wiki setup and maintenance.
 * [#trouble-shooting Trouble-shooting] helps with fixing any general problems you might encounter, which apply to any installation platform.
