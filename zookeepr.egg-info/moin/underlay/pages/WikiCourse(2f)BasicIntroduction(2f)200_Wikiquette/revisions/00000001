= Wikiquette - how do I behave correctly? =

== Cooperative Editing ==

Basic principle: ''Anybody logged in can edit anything.''

Exceptions:
 * If you want to edit a page without being disturbed, just write a note to that effect ''at the top'' of the page and save that change first.
 * If two people edit a page simultaneously, the first can save normally, but the second will get a warning and should follow the directions to merge their changes with the already saved data.
 * Personal Homepages: normally only changed by their owner, but you may append messages at the end of the page

In general, do follow any hints given on a page, there is generally no ''enforced'' limit, but you should not blindly ignore other people's wishes.
