This macro includes the formatted content of the given local wiki page(s), following
recursive includes if encountered. If the recursion generates any cycles, this is detected and prevented!

'''Usage:'''
 {{{
[[Include(pagename, heading, level, from="regex", to="regex", sort=ascending|descending, items=n, skipitems=n, titlesonly, editlink)]]
}}}

 pagename:: Name of the page to include, if it starts with a caret "`^`", a regex of pages to include.
 heading::  Text for the generated heading which will link to the included page (optional).
 level::    Level (1..5) of the generated heading (optional).
 from::     Partial include start marker (optional).
 to::       Partial include end marker (optional).
 sort::     Sorting order when pagename is a regex, i.e. starts with a caret (optional).
 items::    Maximum number of pages to include.   
 skipitems:: Number of initial pages to skip over (optional).
 titlesonly:: Only include a link to the page, not page content (optional).
 editlink:: add a footer with links to the included page, both normal and edit (optional, available since MoinMoin 1.3.4).
 
All parameters except pagename are optional, but you have to follow the given order! If you want to omit "`heading`", you have to leave the second parameter empty.

`from` and `to` recognise the pattern in comments as well. So watch out for comments that stop the include unexpectedly.

'''Examples:'''
 * `[[Include(FooBar)]]` -- include the text of page `FooBar` in the current paragraph
 * `[[Include(FooBar,"Foo Bar" )]]` -- add a linked H1 of 'Foo Bar' followed by the text
 * `[[Include(FooBar, , 2)]]` -- add a H2 of 'Foo Bar'
 * `[[Include(FooBar, 'All about Foo Bar', 2)]]` -- add a H2 of 'All about Foo Bar'
 * `[[Include(FooBar, , from="^----$")]]` -- only include content after first horizontal rule
 * `[[Include(FooBar, , to="^----$")]]` -- only include content until first horizontal rule
 * `[[Include(^FooBar/.*, , sort=descending)]]` -- sort the page list in decending order
 * `[[Include(^FooBar/.*, , items=3)]]` -- include maximal three pages
 * `[[Include(^BlogBase/.*,, to="^----$", sort=descending, items=7)]]` -- show at most a week of a blog
 * `[[Include(^BlogBase/.*,, to="^----$", sort=descending, items=7, skipitems=7, titlesonly)]]` -- show the previous week with titles only
 * You can use these with MoinMoin:MonthCalendar for blogging:
  * `[[Include(^FirstnameLastname/20..-..-..,,to="^----",sort=descending,items=3)]]` -- show 3 items out of a month calendar
  * `[[Include(^FirstnameLastname/20..-..-..,,to="^----",sort=descending,items=4,skipitems=3,titlesonly)]]` -- show next 4 items only with titles
