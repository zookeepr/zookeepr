With the MoinMoin search engine the same search patterns are allowed in the search and title search input fields as in the parameters for the {{{FullSearch}}} and the {{{PageList}}} macros.

 * There may be several search term seperated by white space
  * Terms are combined by default with an AND operation - only pages containing all search term are returned
  * Double or single quotes may be used to include white space into search terms.
 * {{{-}}} before a search term means NOT - pages containing this term are excluded from the result
 * {{{regex:TERM}}} is treated as regular expression
 * {{{title:TERM}}} searches in pages that their titles match TERM
  * Normal search terms do search the titles, too. Matches in titles get more weight as matches in pages.
 * {{{case:TERM}}} searches case sensitive
 * {{{linkto:TERM}}} searches for links to TERM
 * {{{title:}}}, {{{regex:}}}, {{{linkto:}}} and {{{case:}}} may be used in combination in one search term
  * these modifiers may be abbreviated to any length: e. g. {{{re:}}}, {{{t:}}}, {{{reg:}}}, {{{cas:}}}, {{{l:}}}
  * {{{-}}} must be put before any other modifiers
 * {{{or}}} operator has a lower precedence than the implicit AND
 * Parentheses can be used for grouping

== Examples ==

{{{
title:Help macro
}}}
searches for help pages that contain the word "macro".

{{{
apple (computer or "operating system")
}}}
searches for pages containing the word "apple" and at least one of "computer" or "operating system".

{{{
windows winamp or linux xmms
}}}
searches for pages containing both "windows" and "winamp", and also for pages containing both "linux" and "xmms".

{{{
"is text"
}}}
Will match "th'''is text'''" or "'''is text'''s". Quotes are used only to include whitespace, and do not mean "exactly this phrase".

{{{
linkto:WindowsPage title:Linux
}}} searches for pages that have "Linux" in the page name and that link to !WindowsPage

{{{
r:\bdog\b
}}} searches for the word "dog" and does ''not'' find e.g. the word "doggy"

== TitleSearch and PageList ==
 * uses the same patterns
 * {{{title:}}} is virtually added to every search term
