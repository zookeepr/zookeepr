= Using the Editor =

To edit a page, just click on [[Icon(edit)]] or on the link "`EditText`" at the end of the page. A form will appear enabling you to change text and save it again. A backup copy of the previous page's content is made each time.

You can check the appearance of the page without saving it by using the preview function - ''without'' creating an entry on RecentChanges; additionally there will be an intermediate save of the page content, if you have created a homepage ([[Icon(home)]] is visible).

<!> After editing pages, please leave the edit form by "`Save Changes`" since otherwise your edits will be lost!
