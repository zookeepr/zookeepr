= What is a Wiki? =

 * a technology for collaborative creation of internet and intranet pages
 * ''Wiki-Wiki'' is hawaiian and means fast
 
== Principles ==
 * '''Fast''' - fast editing, communicating and easy to learn

 * '''Open''' - everybody may read ''and'' edit everything
 * '''Uncomplicated''' - everything works in a standard browser
 * '''Easy''' - no HTML knowledge necessary, simply formatted text
 * '''Simple''' - ''Content over Form'' (content counts, not the super-pretty appearance)
 * '''Secure''' - every change is archived, nothing gets lost
 * '''Interlinked''' - Links between pages are easy to make
 * '''Flexible'''
   * Personal Information Management, Knowledgebases, Brainstorming
   * Collaboration, Coordination and Communication platform
   * Creating documentation and slide shows ;)
   * etc...
